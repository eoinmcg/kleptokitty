## About

> "If a black cat crosses your path, count your diamonds,
for they may vanish by dawn"

You are Kleptokitty - whisker-twitching, tail-flicking, diamond-snatching
master of meow-heist mischief. The mansion is full of riches, traps, and
clueless guards... but none of them stand a chance against the purrfect
crime.

## How To Play

__Swipe / Arrow keys / WASD to move__

- Find keys
- Collect loot
- Escape
- ...and don't get caught
  
__[M]__ to mute.
