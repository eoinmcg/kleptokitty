<h1> KleptoKitty </h1>
<h2> A Post Mortem </h2>


<h3> The Background </h3>
<p>
      <img src="mugshot.png" class="right" alt="A picture of our hero, KleptoKitty" />
Every year when 13th August rolls round developers from across 
the globe put away unfinished side projects to start something new.
Namely the <a href="https://js13kgames.com">js13k game jam</a> - an annual challenge to create
a javascript game in under 13k or under (zipped). Running from
13th Aug to 13th September for the past 14 years it has gained
something of a cult following and spawned some amazing games.

<h3> The Beginning </h3>
<p>
      When this year theme 'Black Cat', dropped I was pretty excited
and had a few compelling ideas. However, life and other commitments
meant I was unable to make a start until the final week. Nothing
like a tight deadline and a small game to get motivated. Previous
years I rolled my own game engine but in the interests of variety,
I opted for a pre-made engine - 
<a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS">LittleJS</a>.
It's battle tested, performant and I had some 
<a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/960757">experience with it in the past</a>.
</p>


<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>
Recently, I have been re-playing some old classics such as Mark of the Ninja
and Tomb of the Mask to name a few. These influences pushed me towards
stealth combined with the slick controls and dopamine explosions of Tomb of the Mask.
Given the theme, our hero was predestined to be a black cat. I settled on
the idea of sneaking around a mansion accruing loot, avoiding guards and traps.
</p>

<h3> The Prototype </h3>
<p>
LittleJS allowed me to knock out a basic game in a couple of hours. It's super
efficient 2d map system saved me re-inventing the wheel and after
some caffine fuelled keyboard bashing I had come up with a playable demo.
</p>

<p>
I then added a dash of bling;
<ul class="boom">
  <li>run particles with the built-in 
    <a href="https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/particles/">particle system</a>
  </li>
  <li>glimmer on the diamond by superimposing a few shapes</li>
  <li>simple blur trail related to speed</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
        <figure class="image-wrap transparent">
          <img src="t.gif" width="100%" alt="tileset containing all images used in the game">
          <figcaption>8x8 tile set, weighing in at a measly 301bytes</figcaption>
      </figure>
</p>

<p>
      LittleJS makes coloring image tiles super simple so I was able to get a lot
      of extra mileage by simply coloring white tiles. This worked well for creating
      vibrant wall tiles and the multicolored diamonds.
      <img src="vids/loot.png" alt="screenshot showing multicolored levels and diamonds" />
</p>

<h3> The Muzak </h3>
<p>
Good tunes are a really important component of a fun game. Not being
musically, inclined I turned to AI for a helping hand. I wanted
a jazzy track, along the lines of the Pink Panther. Claude.ai did its best!
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> As a starting point I was inspired by this wonderful 
<a href="https://github.com/repsej/TheWayOfTheDodo">postmortem</a>.
<br />Basically, the lightweight <a href="https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/">ZzFXM</a>
coupled with basic patterns which are then randomized.
</p>

<h3>The Problems</h3>
<p>
At this point it seemed all was going well and at full speed. The next
major task would be to design fun and engaging levels. And this is where
the wheels came off, a bit. Rather than focus on this new challenge, I
decided that a level editor would be beneficial in the long run. So,
I proceeded to eat into my dwindling time budget by making a level editor:
<img src="vids/mapeditor.png" alt="The Map Editor">
(Note to self: make games not tools!)
</p>

<p>
To be honest, it was a big help but I wasn't left with much time to
work on level design. Ultimately, I opted for what was easier (coding)
at the expense of levels. One positive, though is that the
<a href="https://eoinmcgrath.com/kleptokitty/mapeditor.html">level editor</a>
is built into the 'Directors cut' version. You can even share
your level designs via URL.
</p>

<h3> The Build </h3>
<p>
A tedious part of any front end project / game jam is building, compressing
and deploying the dang thing. Luckily, I had concocted a small 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-js13k-littlejs">npm package</a>
earlier in the summer to handle all this:
<code>
npm create js13k-littlejs
</code>
</p>

<p>
It includes a dev server with hot reloading, deploy to github pages 
and automated build and zipping (using the amazing 
<a href="https://github.com/lifthrasiir/roadroller">
Roadroller</a>)
There is even has a built in animated gif recorder.
</p>


<h3> The Positives </h3>
<p>
<ul class="good">
  <li> Using LittleJS, a lot of the heavy lifting was already done</li>
  <li> Reusing sfx and some gfx from previous games saved time</li>
  <li> Getting to make a game! What could be more fun?</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3> The Negatives </h3>
<p>
<ul class="bad">

<li> Spending too much time messing with the level editor</li>
<li> Starting in the final week </li>
<li> Not having play testers</li>
</ul>
</p>
